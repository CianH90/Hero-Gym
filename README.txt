What I am Doing.
I am creating a three page responsive website for a gym (name to be decided). 
This site will consist of Home, About and contact pages.

Page layout
All pages will have navbar and footer (footer to contain social media links).

Home page will consist of 2-3 sections.
Section one: hero image, logo/Gym name, slogan/quote and a contact button.
section two: cards with a breif description of what to expect on the other pages,
Section Three: gym review/client testimonials.

About page will have two sections,
Section one: a breif "about us" write up.
Section two: information on two-three classes provided in the gym.

Contant page will have one section.
This page will have a contact for that refreshes on submit along with address, phone number and other means of contact.
